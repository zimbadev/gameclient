IntroPart1=BattlEye is anti-cheat software used in online multiplayer games that actively prevents and detects cheating and bans cheaters from playing on BattlEye-protected servers.\n\nIn order to achieve its goal BattlEye installs a system service that is only active while the game is running. The BattlEye system service also temporarily installs and loads a kernel-mode driver.\n\nWhile due to its nature BattlEye needs to have access to great parts of your system, it ensures that your privacy is not violated.\nBattlEye is neither interested in your personal data (documents, passwords, credit card details, etc.) nor any other information that is private to you as an individual.\nEverything that BattlEye does is solely aimed at achieving its goal of preventing and detecting cheating.
